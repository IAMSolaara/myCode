# myCode README

### Contents

This is my GitHub repository dedicated to my various pieces of code.

Every directory in the root is dedicated to a set of languages, like C-derived langs and Java stuff.

You will not probably find binaries (exception made for x86 ASM, that really only works under x86 MS-DOS like dosbox or actual pure DOS so change of architectures is not an issue)

You were probably brought here from my website. Know that this is the first place that gets updated so if you want to stay on the "bleeding edge" this is the place to go as I remember to update the site's clone only 3-4 times a week.

In Templates you can find various templates for stuff like Makefiles (I use them myself so I can generalize things here as much as possible).

You can find not only my personal projects, but also whatever I do at school, in the \{langset\}/\{lang\}/school directory, where langset and langs are what I described earlier, grouped by school year.

I want this repo to not only be a place where I can put my code for archival and ease of switching between machines, but also a place where my classmates can look at my code, to help them further in case our learning material is scarce or not clear enough on a certain subject (it happened, so I know what I'm talking about, unfortunately).

Usually you will only need to do `make` in a directory to get an executable and where I use libraries such as ncurses, GTK, SDL etc.. I try to put READMEs so people know what steps to reproduce before actually compiling code.

It is also to note however that some places do not have such files, such as LaTeX sources, x86 ASM sources and shell scripts for either obvious or already stated reasons.

You can of course help me get better at this by either opening an issue or just dropping me an email at <lorenzocauli162@gmail.com> and I will try to reply as soon as possible.

Had you not realized earlier, I have my own website, [https://mentalabs.eu](https://mentalabs.eu) (yes, it has SSL encryption courtesy of Let's Encrypt, no promo here), where you can find more things I do like my Doom servers, should you want to play a game there, or maybe check out my bullettin board, where I put some thoughts now and then. 

Do note that sometimes it may be down for different issues like power outages (not that frequent) or just random errors that can occur for random reasons.

Greetings and have a good day.
